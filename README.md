# Rust-Detection
An algorithm that uses Python and OpenCV to detect rust on metallic surfaces.

The Test_Images and ImageTransform_OrthogonalView are files contatining test images to rust_det.py and img_trans.py respectively.

NOTE: the rust_det.py code wis designed to work best on pictures of surfaces taken at an orthiginal view.
If the picture you have is not, use the img_trans.py code to do so. In that code, you'll need to manually specify the pixel location of the main corners of 
your surface. The code will then create a corresponfding orthogonal projection.

If you have any questions, please contact me and I'll be happy to explain / discuss.

Also, If you have any ideas to improve the code, creatively or algorithmically, contact me ! I'd love to share ideas and learn =)
